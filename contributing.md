# Contribution Guidelines


Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- **The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the thing you're submitting and why it should be included.**
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Templates and examples will be limited as there are a lot of them, with little to none difference.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Please provide only free and open source materials. This is not the place to promote paid work.
- Use the following format: `[title](link) - Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant section.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't mention `Game deising document` in the description as it's implied.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.

Thank you for your suggestion!
